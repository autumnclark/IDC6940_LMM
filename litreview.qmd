## Autumn's Literature Review

### [Fixing Linear Mixed Models in R - R News](https://svn.r-project.org/R-project-web/trunk/md/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2005-1.pdf#page=27){target="_blank"} 

This article provides an in-depth guide on using the lme4 package for fitting linear mixed-effects models in R. Bates discusses the theoretical foundations of mixed-effects models, including fixed and random effects, and shows how to specify and fit these models using the lmer function. The article includes examples and code snippets to illustrate model fitting, interpretation of results, and considerations for model selection and diagnostics. This resource will be valuable for our project by helping us apply mixed-effects modeling techniques in our analyses. [@BatesandDouglas2005]

### [Linear and Generalized Linear Mixed Models](https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/R/misc/foxchapter/14-Fox-Chap13.pdf){target="_blank"}

The primary goal of this paper it to provide a clear guide for applying generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and linear mixed models (LMMs), within ecology and evolutionary biology. Bolker aims to bridge a gap between the statistical theory and real-world application by providing guidance on model specification, software tools, and interpretation. GLMMs and LMMs permit researchers to model non-independent data, such as repeated measures or nested sampling, with regard to both fixed and random effects. These models are particulary useful in ecological data, where such data this is common. However, these models can be difficult to implement and interpret correctly and efficiently. This paper is important because it illustrates these methods and encourages correct use, reducing misue or misinterpretation. [@Bolker2015]

### [Comparison of linear mixed models for genetic feather score analysis in laying hens kept in recurrent testing facilities - Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579125000707){target="_blank"}

This paper focuses on evaluating and comparing six different linear mixed models (LMMs) for analyzing feather score (FS) data in laying hens inhabited in recurrent testing (RT) facilities. The goal is to determine which model accurately estimates genetic parameters and breeding values, taking into account the data structure of RT environments. [@Osorio-Gallardo2025]

### [Determining bad actors: A linear mixed effects model approach to elucidate behavioral toxicity of metal mixtures in drinking water - NIH.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39536556/){target="_blank"}

This study develops a hierarchical linear mixed-effects modeling approach to identify which individual metals and their mixtures ("bad actors") that could pose a risk for behavioral/neurodevelopmental toxicity, as experimented through larval zebrafish behavioral assays. Chemical mixtures in drinking water can cause health risks, even when chemicals are presented below regulatory limits. This research provides a statistical method to detect discrete behavioral effects from complex mixtures. In order to detect this, the authors analyzed 92 drinking water samples from Maine and New Hampshire, each contatining multiple metal mixtures. They used a linear mixed-effects model that accounted for repeated measures (time), individual variability (larvae), and sample-level effects. The model included random effects for larvae and samples and fixed effects for metal concentrations. This allowed them to identify notable individual metals and metal mixtures that affect larval locomotor activity. [@Dilrukshi2024]


### [Approximate Inference in Generalized Linear Mixed Models](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1993.10594284){target="_blank"}

This paper's goal is to find easier ways to make statistical estimates in GLMMs. These models can be very hard to work with because they involved challenging calculations for random effects. The authors suggest practical methods to simplify these calculations which then can make the models easier to use. GLMMs are essential for analyzing data that display both fixed and random effects, specially in cases involving overdispersion and correlated observations. Breslow and Clayton propose using the Laplace approximations to approximate the random effects in the likelihood function of GLMMs. They create formulas based on a method called penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) to estimate fixed effects and another techniqe called pseudo-likelihood to estimate variance. These formulas make it possible to estimate model parameters without the complicated and challenging calculations. This paper is important because it offers simplified methods that make it possible to use GLMMs in real-world situations, which allows others to apply them in other areas of research. [@Breslow1993]

### [Analyzing dynamic species abundance distributions using generalized linear mixed models - JSTOR.org](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27189482){target="_blank"}

This paper demonstrates how GLMMs can be used to analyze dynamic species abundance distributions (DSADs), which is how species numbers change over time and across different places. The authors want to separate the reasons for these changes, like the environment, differences between species, or random chance. In order to protect biodiversity, it is important to understand why some species become more or less common. Current existing methods do not show which factors are causing these changes. This paper does a great job of offering a clear method for ecologist to understand these patterns. These authors use GLMMs with random effects to represent ecological changes. They test this method using computer simulations and apply it to real data from fish and bat populations to test how well it works. The method proves to work well to show what is driving changes in species numbers. In addition, it works better when population changes are controlled. This paper is important because it provides a simple way for scientists to understand changes in species population using GLMMs, which then helps identify what is affecting the biodiversity over time and space.

## Alex's Literature Review

 Understanding complex, hierarchical data has become increasingly important across disciplines such as epidemiology, cardiology, psychology, and public health. Among the most powerful and flexible tools for analyzing such data is the Linear Mixed Model (LMM). LMMs extend traditional linear regression by incorporating both fixed effects, which account for population-level trends, and random effects, which capture variability across individual units or clusters. This structure enables LMMs to model correlated data such as repeated measures from the same subject or observations nested within groups without violating the assumption of independence required by simpler models.
The usefulness of LMMs is particularly evident in medical and health research, where individual variability is often substantial. For instance, [@Goncalves2005] highlighted the superior performance of LMMs over ANOVA in evaluating heart rate and coronary-perfused pressure data in transgenic mice. Their work demonstrated how LMMs provide a more sensitive and robust framework for assessing experimental effects in biomedical studies, particularly when data are unbalanced or collected over time. 


In cardiovascular research, sleep disturbances have been identified as significant contributors to abnormal nocturnal blood pressure (BP) profiles factors that increase the risk of adverse cardiac events. [@Matsumoto2019] employed LMMs in their investigation of sleep efficiency and nocturnal BP using multi-day observational data. Their use of random effects allowed them to control for between-subject variability while modeling day-to-day BP fluctuations, resulting in more accurate estimates of the associations. The study supported previous findings that lower sleep efficiency is linked to higher nighttime BP levels and diminished nocturnal BP dips [@Kario2001; @Mano2021; Miki et al., 2022).


The advantages of LMMs extend to the modeling of 24-hour physiological processes. [@EdwardsandSimpson2014] utilized orthonormal polynomials within LMMs to analyze 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring data. Their approach enhanced both the accuracy and interpretability of BP trajectories over time, providing clinicians with detailed insights into circadian rhythm variations in patient data. LMMs allowed for complex modeling without overfitting, an essential property when working with high-frequency longitudinal health data.
Moreover, LMMs have proven especially valuable in large-scale clinical outcomes research. 


[@Wang2022] showcased the strength of LMMs using a dataset from over 600 patients who underwent pulmonary valve replacement surgery. With more than 5,000 echocardiographic measurements over multiple years, the study leveraged LMMs to model both fixed effects (e.g., treatment procedures, age, sex) and random effects (e.g., patient-specific recovery trajectories). LMMs allowed the researchers to handle missing data, unbalanced measurement schedules, and inter-patient heterogeneity more effectively than traditional linear models or survival analysis.
Together, these studies establish LMMs as a critical tool in longitudinal and repeated-measures research, offering flexibility, accuracy, and interpretability. This paper builds on that foundation by applying LMMs to the COVID-19 Worldwide Testing dataset, which contains country-level, time-indexed data on daily testing and positivity rates. While the subject differs from cardiovascular data, the analytical challenges such as repeated observations, between-country variability, and time trends are strikingly similar. The goal is to illustrate how LMMs can uncover meaningful patterns in large public health datasets, ultimately guiding more informed decision-making in times of global crisis.
